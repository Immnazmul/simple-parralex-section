    <h1>Explore The Parallax World!</h1>
    <p>Observed from Earth, the night sky appears two-dimensional. But it's anything but. However, it took astronomers thousands of years to figure out how to measure distances of stars from our planet and create actual three-dimensional maps reflecting the distribution of stars and galaxies in the universe. One of the key methods they use is the so-called parallax, which relies on the same effect as stereoscopic vision.</p>
